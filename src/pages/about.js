              Hi I'm Ted! I'm currently a 3rd year Engineering Science student in the ECE stream at the University of Toronto.
              <br /><br />
              A bit on life recently, my third year in the ECE stream has been super rewarding because I feel like I made the best possible choice for myself,
              finding interest in topics such as computer architecture, electronics, and communication. This fails to never inspire me, 
              and I am curious as to what the future holds for me here.
              <br /><br />
              For me, it's not that deepâ€”just balance three things: Academics, Athletics, and Mental Health.
              Academics: What to do with life. Athletics: Type of person you want to be in life. Mental Health: To keep it going.
              <br /><br />
